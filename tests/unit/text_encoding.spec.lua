-- The localisation XML is stored as windows-1251, one byte per Cyrillic
-- letter, and must stay that way.
--
-- A regression guard for damage that already happened. Across ten revisions
-- (f177d70, d8af180, af26ed0, 42aca5e, d3347ee, 6594b15, ac8a81c, 718d1ca,
-- f3306f4, 94535ac) the rus tables were committed as UTF-8; e5494dc put them
-- back. Each round trip is an editor, not a person: VS Code guesses an encoding
-- when it opens a cp1251 file, guesses wrong, and rewrites every Cyrillic byte
-- on save. The tree is correct now, so this spec is green as written -- it was
-- confirmed to fail by re-encoding rus/ui_st_mcm_soulslite.xml to UTF-8, and
-- again for the BOM and declaration cases.
--
-- Nothing else here catches it. The engine's XML reader is not encoding-aware
-- in any useful sense -- it takes the bytes as they are and hands them to
-- cp1251 font tables -- so a UTF-8 file still parses, every <string id> still
-- resolves, and `mcm_localization.spec.lua` stays green while every Russian
-- label in the menu renders as mojibake. The declaration is no help either: it
-- keeps saying windows-1251 through the whole thing, so the diff looks
-- innocent. It has to be checked at the byte level or not at all.
--
-- Reference for a correct file: any stock Anomaly/GAMMA translation, e.g.
-- "HD Glowsticks" rus/st_items_glowstick.xml -- declaration windows-1251,
-- single-byte Cyrillic in 0xC0..0xFF, no BOM.
--
-- Line endings are deliberately NOT asserted. Stock files use LF and ours use
-- CRLF; the engine reads both, and core.autocrlf rewrites them on checkout
-- anyway, so pinning them would fail for a reason nobody should care about.
